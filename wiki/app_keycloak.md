# KeyCloak (SSO)


## Testing & Debugging

If you need to do some testing and debugging you can build the docker image from here: https://github.com/GetLevvel/oauth2-oidc-debugger run the container locally and point it SSO.

This container will return tokens that you can decrypt here: https://jwt.io/
