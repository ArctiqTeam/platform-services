# Trust No One

With the addition of new security components BCDevExchange's Platform Services is able to offer product teams the ability to operate in a Zero Trust security model; Zero Trust is a security model where you don't trust anything outside of your own components (pods), even pods don't trust each other!

The model works by using application identities created for each component/Processing Unit/pod (Web, API, Database, etc) of an application and custom network security policies that are added to an application as `NetworkSecurityPolicy` (NSP) custom resource objects (for more advanced solutions, `ExternalNetworks` (EN) objects), to explicity allow communication between the components.  

**:point_up: Note**
* New namespaces provisioned on the Platform after Oct 9, 2019 come with **Zero-Trust Model enabled by default**. In order to enable application pods to communicate with Internet, with the Platform,  with other namespaces, or among themselves, a `NetworkSecurityPolicy` must be **manually** created in the application as described in the *QuickStart* guide below.

* Communication rules defined in the custom network security policy described in the `NetworkSecurityPolicy` object must be created for **both direction** in order to enable the communication, e.g. namespace A is allowed talk to namespace B AND namespace B is allowed to talk to namespace A. 

```
spec:
  description: |
    allow nmspc1-dev to talk to nmspc2-dev
  destination:
    - - $namespace=nmspcA-dev
    - - $namespace=nmspcB-dev
  source:
    - - $namespace=nmspcB-dev
    - - $namespace=nmspcA-dev
``` 

**ðŸ¤“ ProTip**

* Assume that the network and platform are insecure and built up robust security practices.

If your application was deployed to the Platform prior to the secury model install on Oct 9, 2019, 3 base access policies have been added to all application namespaces - DEV, TEST, TOOLS and PROD - to keep their communications running without any impact. To modify the application's base access policy, see the [Custom Network Security Policy](./CustomPolicy.md) section below.

## Projects

This is a list of some projects that have already implemented a Zero Trust security model:

* [Family Protection Order (FPO)](https://github.com/bcgov/Family-Protection-Order) application - [search](https://github.com/bcgov/Family-Protection-Order/search?q=NetworkSecurityPolicy&unscoped_q=NetworkSecurityPolicy) for "networksecuritypolicy" in the repo to see how FPO implemented their network security policies.
